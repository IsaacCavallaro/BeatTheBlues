# Software Development Plan

- 

## Purpose & Scope

- BeatTheBlues is a terminal app which generates a 12 bar blues chord progression for beginner musicians. 

- Practicing music, like playing an instrument is a skill. The skills of practicing an instrument effectively can be a particularly challenging skill to learn for the beginner musician; in addition to learning various techniques to play an instrument. 

- As a student of music and educator, I have seen musicians struggle with knowing what to practice and keeping track of their progress. This is why I am building this app. 

## What problem does BeatTheBlues solve?

- The first aim of BeatTheBlues is to help beginning musicians learn 12 bar blues variations in all twelve keys. 

- The second aim of the app is to help beginning musicians decide what to practice in a given session. In short, alleviate decision fatigue. 

- Finally, the app can track/save and load the progress of the users.

## Target Audience

- Beginner musicians.

- A basic knowledge of music theory is helpful (specifically how to build major and minor chords).

- The app is particularly useful for people wanting to learn music as a hobby and who donâ€™t have access to a private tutor. 


# Features

## Feature 1.1

- Users can specify the complexity (the number of chord changes) in the suggested progression.

- Users can select from three differing levels of difficulty; level 1, level 2, level 3. 

##  Example of Feature 1.1

- The two pictures below illustrate the user "EXAMPLE" selecting level 1 and the returned progression in Roman Numerals.

- Before moving on, BeatTheBlues will display this progression to the user and check if they are ready to move on. 

- This way the user can easily reselect a new level/progression if they wish; without having to exit the application.
